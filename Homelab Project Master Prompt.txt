Homelab Project Master Prompt

Project Name: Mini-Netflix Homelab

Project Goal:
Build a mini-Netflix style application to learn and showcase skills in Linux (Debian), Docker, Kubernetes (K8s), CI/CD, monitoring, and SRE practices. The end goal is a production-ready setup that can run microservices, be deployed in containers, and be observable via monitoring dashboards.

1. Objective

Learn and implement:

Linux server administration (Debian)

Containerization with Docker

Orchestration with Kubernetes (K8s)

CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions / Jenkins

Monitoring using Grafana, Kibana, Datadog

Logging, alerting, and error tracking

Portfolio readiness: Document every step professionally in GitHub, including architecture diagrams, command explanations, code snippets, and screenshots.

2. Current Requirements & Background

Laptop: Intel Celeron D 4th gen, 4GB RAM (suitable for lightweight Debian VM or container setups)

OS Installed: Debian

User: Akash (root access available)

Tools already considered: VS Code, GitHub for version control, Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring tools

Target: Build a microservice-based application simulating Netflix (video catalog, user management, streaming simulation)

3. Methodology & Roadmap
Phase 1 – Debian Post-Install Setup

Update system packages

Create non-root user with sudo privileges (Akash)

Configure SSH access for remote control

Setup firewall and basic security

Portfolio tip: Document all commands with explanations of what each command does. 
Phase 3 – Docker & Microservices

Learn Docker fundamentals: images, containers, volumes, networks

Containerize each microservice:

User Service

Catalog Service

Streaming Service (simulation)

Test containers locally

Portfolio tip: Include Dockerfile examples and docker-compose.yml with comments explaining each service.

Phase 4 – Kubernetes Orchestration

Install Minikube or K3s for lightweight local K8s

Convert Docker containers into Kubernetes Deployments & Services

Learn K8s concepts: Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, Services, Ingress

Test scaling and rolling updates

Portfolio tip: Include K8s YAML files and architecture diagrams showing service connections.

Phase 5 – CI/CD Pipeline

Setup GitHub Actions / Jenkins pipelines:

Build Docker images on commit

Push to container registry

Deploy to Kubernetes cluster automatically

Automate testing and notifications

Portfolio tip: Document workflow with screenshots, YAML files, and CI/CD flow diagrams.

Phase 6 – Monitoring & Logging

Deploy monitoring stack: Grafana + Prometheus + Loki or Datadog

Configure dashboards for:

Response time

Failed requests

Throughput

Server-side errors

Request counts

Setup alerts for errors or high latency

Portfolio tip: Include screenshots of dashboards and alerting rules.

Phase 7 – Documentation & Portfolio

Create professional README.md with:

Project description

Architecture diagram

Steps to setup locally

Docker & K8s commands explained

CI/CD flow

Monitoring dashboards screenshots

Include docs/ folder with detailed guides and scripts/ folder for automation scripts

Portfolio tip: Make it visually appealing, easy to follow, and suitable to share with recruiters.

4. Key Commands to Document

Debian system updates, user management, firewall setup

Docker commands: docker build, docker run, docker-compose up

Kubernetes commands: kubectl apply, kubectl get pods, kubectl logs

CI/CD triggers & pipeline steps

Monitoring setup commands

Example format for documentation:
5. Success Criteria

Fully working mini-Netflix app running in Docker/K8s

CI/CD pipeline fully automated

Monitoring dashboards with alerts implemented

Documentation polished for GitHub portfolio
